I write a demo like the rabbitmq work-queues tutorials(http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html) with rabbitmq-c lib

rmq_new_task.c is to new_task.py
rmq_worker.c is to worker.py

other files is from the rabbitmq-c source files.

You need the librabbitmq.a to compile the project.

newer:
a demo like the routing(http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-four-python.html) with rabbitmq-c lib

emit_log_direct.c is to emit_log_direct.py
receive_logs_direct.c is to receive_logs_direct.py
